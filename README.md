# 🚀 LeetCode + DSA Journey

Welcome to my public repository where I document my journey of solving **LeetCode problems** and learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  

The goal of this repo is simple:  
- Build strong problem-solving skills.  
- Learn core data structures and algorithms deeply.  
- Stay consistent by solving and committing regularly.  
- Share progress openly so others can learn (and keep me accountable).

## 📚 What’s Inside
- Each file represents one solved problem.  
- Problems are solved in no particular order (random practice).  
- File names are based on the problem title for easy lookup.  


---

## 🎯 Mission
> Solve LeetCode problems daily, sharpen DSA skills, and grow into a better software engineer — while keeping the journey transparent and open to everyone.

---

## 💡 How to Use
- Browse problems by filename or folder.  
- Read inline comments in code for explanations.  
- Clone/fork if you want to follow along or practice on your own.


🛠️ Tech Stack

TypeScript for writing solutions.

Node.js for execution environment.

ts-node for running TypeScript directly without manual compilation.
