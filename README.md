# 🚀 LeetCode + DSA Journey

Welcome to my public repository where I document my journey of solving **LeetCode problems** and learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

The goal of this repo is simple:

- Build strong problem-solving skills.
- Learn core data structures and algorithms deeply.
- Stay consistent by solving and committing regularly.
- Share progress openly so others can learn (and keep me accountable).

---

## 📚 What’s Inside

- Each problem has its **own folder**.
- Every folder contains:
  - `README.md` → problem description and notes.
  - `Solution.ts` → TypeScript solution file.
- Problems are solved in no particular order (random practice).

---

## 🎯 Mission

- Solve LeetCode problems daily.
- Sharpen DSA skills.
- Grow into a better software engineer.
- Keep the journey transparent and open to everyone.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** for writing solutions.
- **Node.js** for execution environment.
- **ts-node** for running TypeScript directly without manual compilation.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-code077/LeetCode-DSA-Journey.git
  cd LeetCode-DSA-Journey
  ```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Navigate to a problem folder (example: TwoSum):

```bash
cd TwoSum
```

Run the solution file with npx:

```bash
npx ts-node TwoSum.ts
```

or either you can change the package.json start command

    "start": "ts-node fileName.ts",
